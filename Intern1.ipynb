      "### Chapter I: The Canoe Builder\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick, perched on a coral ledge, gazed south. Behind him, the ocean thundered, its spray windblown; before him, the Karolin lagoon stretched calm and vast, a blue mirror reflecting the sky, punctuated by fishing gulls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ringed by a forty-mile coral reef, this immense lagoon was a sea unto itself—stormy in high winds, tranquil in gentler breezes—and it was his. He, a newcomer of only yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beach teemed with activity: women, children, and youths toiled in the sun, fishing, playing, or tending *paraka* patches.  They were his people. The beached canoes and empty canoe houses, once filled with war canoes, were his as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "His gaze shifted from lagoon to canoe houses, a frown etching his brow. He turned from the calm lagoon to face the turbulent northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible yet present, lay Palm Tree Island—a paradise in his dreams, a devil's lair in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearby, young Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, watched him. Tari knew little of life, but understood that war had left Karolin's women and children vulnerable, leaderless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, yesterday, a strange boat from the north had arrived, bearing this stranger and Katafa, the girl lost at sea years before. The women hailed him as a god-sent chief and ruler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The child knew nothing of gods, nor did he care. He addressed Dick directly, with childlike simplicity:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Taori,” little Tari asked, “who are you?” (é kamina tai)\n",
      "\n",
      "Could Dick have answered honestly? Would the child have understood?  *\"Tari, I come from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange, and as a child, smaller than you, I was shipwrecked on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles north, with an old sailor, Kearney. He taught me to fish and build toys—little ships unlike your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the girl lost in the storm. After Kearney died, we escaped Melanesian men who'd cut down trees, killing other white men and burning their ship. We fled in our boat, guided by the lagoon's light to Karolin.\"*\n",
      "\n",
      "But he couldn't tell Tari this, not entirely. The name \"Dick\" and his childhood language were fading memories. Kearney, his guardian, was almost forgotten, lost in the hazy past.\n",
      "\n",
      "For shipwrecked survivors, the past blurs. For Dick, his past began with Katafa's arrival on Marua; before that, everything was swallowed by the tropical sun, storms, and rainy seasons. Only Kearney's toy ships remained, tangible remnants of a forgotten time.\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at the questioning child.  “I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” the child replied. “I ask as I breathe, but adults—*madyana*—never answer Tari’s questions. Ai, the fish!”  His attention drifted to children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick's gaze returned to the north. The child's question stirred memories: the burned schooner, his escape with Katafa, their arrival, the women hailing him as a divinely appointed leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the memory of those men tainted the beauty of sea and sky.  There was no immediate threat; the Palm Tree men lacked canoes, but they would build them. They would see Karolin's lagoon light, and they would come.  It might be long, but they would come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dick, essentially a native, a Kanaka, yet possessed a white man's mind. He could think strategically, anticipate. That’s why he'd sent for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, expert canoe builders. That’s why, observing the tribe, he'd noted the numerous youths reaching fighting age.  Underpinning it all, fueling his daring, was his love for Katafa, a love, however vaguely, threatened.\n",
      "\n",
      "War canoes! Would he defend the lagoon, or launch a preemptive strike?\n",
      "\n",
      "A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa stood before him, a dark tress escaping her vine hairband, blowing like an eagle's feather. Her dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the north.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” she whispered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under certain conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible through mirage. They had seen it last night, and now it reappeared—a faint smudge resolving into a dreamlike vision, beautiful yet ominous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hand on shoulder, they stood silently, their minds untutored in the ways of mirages, their eyes fixed on their escape route. They relived the savage horde, the race for safety, the Melanesians’ drunken yells. Before them lay the scene of the tragedy, beautiful yet concealing its demons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Dick gazed upon this lovely threat, hate filled him. They had threatened him—nothing. They had threatened Katafa—everything. And they still threatened her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree echoed his instinct. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and come. They lacked women; Karolin had them in abundance. They would search the horizon, find the lagoon's light, and come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danger lay not only in the north, but wherever greed or hatred lurked—among savages and the \"wolves of civilization.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To Dick, the world was limited to the waters encircling the two islands. There was no Europe, no America, no history beyond his own and Katafa's. Yet, even in that short life, he’d learned to fear men, and understood the primal foundation of history—man's instinct for war, violence, and destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vision of Palm Tree faded, vanished. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe. It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the beach to meet it.\n",
